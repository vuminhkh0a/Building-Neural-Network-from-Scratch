# Building-Neural-Network-from-Scratch

This repository contains exercise implementations from the book **Neural Network from Scratch with Python**. Each chapter demonstrates how to build a complete neural network using only core Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks.

## Structure

- `c01_...` to `c21_...`: Jupyter notebooks organized by chapter
- Each notebook builds upon the previous one to form a full neural network
- The complete model is in: c21_saving_loading_params.ipynb


## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you need the following Python packages:

- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- opencv-python (cv2)  
- nnfs  
- jupyter

Install all required packages with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python nnfs jupyter
