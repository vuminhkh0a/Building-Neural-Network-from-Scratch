    "### 1. Partial Derivatives\n",
    "In deep learning, a **partial derivative** measures how a function changes as *one* variable changes, keeping others constant. For a loss function  $L(x, y, z)$ , the partial derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us how sensitive the loss is to changes in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Gradients\n",
    "A **gradient** is a vector that contains all partial derivatives of a function with respect to its inputs. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\nabla L = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} \\right] $\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, gradients are used to update weights via **backpropagation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Chain Rule\n",
    "The **chain rule** allows us to compute derivatives of composite functions. It's essential in backpropagation. If:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ z = f(y), \\quad y = g(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the derivative of \\( z \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dz}{dx} = \\frac{dz}{dy} \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how gradients are propagated layer by layer in deep networks.\n",
